# Movie Recommendation System

Unlock your next favorite film! This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that delivers personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences, leveraging machine learning and data-driven approaches.

## Overview

This system analyzes movie data and uses algorithms such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach to recommend movies that match user interests. It provides a user interface for searching, rating, and receiving tailored recommendations.

## Features

- Provides movie recommendations using advanced filtering algorithms
- Allows users to search for movies by title or partial name
- Users can rate movies (e.g., 1-5 stars), improving the recommendation accuracy
- Admin interface for managing movie data and user access
- User registration and login support for personalized recommendations
- Simple and interactive interface (e.g., via web dashboard or notebook)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
- scikit-learn (for model training and recommendation)
- Web technologies (optional, for deployment)
- Streamlit or Flask (for web UI, if included)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the Movie Recommendation System:

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/Anuj-K-Verma/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Application**
- For notebook-based version: Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute cells.
- For web-app (if implemented):
  ```
  streamlit run main.py
  ```

## Usage

- Register or log in as a user or admin.
- Browse or search for movies in the database.
- Rate movies to enhance personalized recommendations.
- Receive suggestions for similar or popular movies.
- Admins can update and manage movie listings.

## Project Structure

- **data/** : Datasets used for training/testing
- **notebooks/** : Jupyter notebooks used for development and experiments
- **models/** : Saved/trained models (optional)
- **main.py / app.py** : Entry-point for web application (if included)
- **requirements.txt** : List of dependencies

## Algorithms

The system can use:
- Collaborative Filtering (based on user ratings and similarities)
- Content-Based Filtering (based on genres, actors, etc.)
- Hybrid Approaches (combining both for better accuracy)
